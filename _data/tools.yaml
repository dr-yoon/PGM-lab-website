  description: TAILVAR (Terminal codon Analysis and Improved prediction of Lengthened VARiants) is a machine-learning classifier designed specifically to predict the functional impact of stop-loss variants that generate C-terminal protein extensions.
  By integrating transcript-level, protein-level, and variant annotation features, TAILVAR provides accurate assessments that outperform existing tools, offering improved interpretation of elongated protein effects.
