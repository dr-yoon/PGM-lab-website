  description: TAILVAR (Terminal extension Analysis for Improved prediction of Lengthened VARiants) is a machine-learning classifier designed specifically to predict the functional impact of stop-loss variants that generate C-terminal protein extensions. By integrating transcript-level, protein-level, and variant annotation features, TAILVAR provides accurate assessments that outperform existing tools, offering improved interpretation of elongated protein effects.
