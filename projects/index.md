Our research focuses on uncovering disease mechanisms to advance healthcare and treatment, leveraging genetic and genomic tools as well as bioinformatics approaches for precision medicine.  
Below are the main projects and funding sources.

---

## Ongoing Project 1

**Title:** *Development of Nanopore Sequencing-Based Genomic Analysis and Diagnostic Technologies for Clinical Application*  
**Grant No.:** RS-2025-02214700  
**Funding Period:** April 1, 2025 – December 31, 2027  
**Total Expenses:** 550,000,000 KRW  
**Role:** Principal Investigator  

We aim to establish a robust diagnostic infrastructure by:  
- Building a Korean reference genome database  
- Developing advanced data analysis pipelines  
- Designing and evaluating disease-specific gene panels  

Through these efforts, we will validate the clinical utility of nanopore sequencing technology.

**Funding Source:** Global Physician-Scientist Development Program for Early-Career Physician-Scientists, Korea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI)

## Ongoing Project 2

**Title:** *Elucidating the Mechanisms of Cancer Metastasis through Time-Series Multi-Analysis and Developing Control Technologies*  
**Grant No.:** RS-2025-25459146  
**Funding Period:** August 1, 2025 – December 31, 2029  
**Total Expenses:** 6,625,000,000 KRW  
**Role:** Co-Investigator  

The **META-Center** aims to uncover how cancer metastasis occurs.  
Our Group 3-2 team focuses on analyzing epigenomic changes in cancer tissues using long-read sequencing technologies.

**Funding Source:** Global Collaborative Research Support for Physician-Scientists, Korea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI)

## Ongoing Project 3

**Title:** *Novel Gene Discovery and Functional Characterization in Undiagnosed Hereditary Hearing Loss Using Long-Read Sequencing*  
**Grant No.:** D-2025-0010  
**Funding Period:** September 1, 2025 – October 31, 2026  
**Total Expenses:** 50,000,000 KRW  
**Role:** Co-Principal Investigator  

In collaboration with **Prof. Heon Yung Gee** (Department of Pharmacology) and **Prof. Jinsei Jung** (Department of Otorhinolaryngology) at Yonsei University College of Medicine, we will investigate undiagnosed hereditary hearing loss cases to identify novel associated genes and variants using long-read sequencing technology.

**Funding Source:** Gangnam Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine
