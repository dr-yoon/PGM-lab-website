Our research focuses on uncovering disease mechanisms to advance healthcare and treatment, leveraging (but not limited to) genetic and genomic tools and bioinformatics approaches for precision medicine.

## Ongoing project 1

  **Title:** *Development of Nanopore Sequencing-Based Genomic Analysis and Diagnostic Technologies for Clinical Application*  
  **Grant No.:** RS-2025-02214700  
  **Funding Period:** April 1, 2025 – December 31, 2027  
  **Total Expenses:** 550,000,000 KRW
  **Role:** Principal Investigator

We aim to establish a robust diagnostic infrastructure by building a Korean reference genome database, developing advanced data analysis pipelines, and designing as well as evaluating disease-specific gene panels. Through these efforts, we will validate the clinical utility of nanopore sequencing technology.
  
  **Funding Source:**  Global Physician-Scientist Development Program for Early-Career Physician-Scientists, Korea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI)

## Ongoing project 2

  **Title:** *Elucidating the Mechanisms of Cancer Metastasis through Time-Series Multi-Analysis and Developing Control Technologies*  
  **Grant No.:** RS-2025-25459146  
  **Funding Period:** September 1, 2025 – December 31, 2029  
  **Total Expenses:** 6,625,000,000 KRW
  **Role:** Co-Investigator


META-Center aims to uncover how cancer metastasis occurs. Our Group 3-2 team focuses on analyzing epigenomic changes in cancer tissues with long-read sequencing technologies.

## Ongoing project 3

  **Title:** *Novel Gene Discovery and Functional Characterization in Undiagnosed Hereditary Hearing Loss Using Long-Read Sequencing*  
  **Grant No.:** D-2025-0010  
  **Funding Period:** September 1, 2025 – October 31, 2026  
  **Total Expenses:** 50,000,000 KRW
  **Role:** Co-Principal Investigator

In collaboration with **Prof. Heon Yung Gee** (Department of Pharmacology) and **Prof. Jinsei Jung** (Department of Otorhinolaryngology) at Yonsei University College of Medicine, we will investigate undiagnosed hereditary hearing loss cases to identify novel associated genes and variants using long-read sequencing technology.
