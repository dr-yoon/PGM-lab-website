## Ongoing projects

  **Project Title:** *Development of Nanopore Sequencing-Based Genomic Analysis and Diagnostic Technologies for Clinical Application*  
  **Grant No.:** RS-2025-02214700  
  **Funding Period:** April 1, 2025 â€“ December 31, 2027  
  **Total Expenses:** 550,000,000 KRW

We aim to establish a robust diagnostic infrastructure by building a Korean reference genome database, developing advanced data analysis pipelines, and designing as well as evaluating disease-specific gene panels. Through these efforts, we will validate the clinical utility of nanopore sequencing technology.
  
  **Funding Source:**  Global Physician-Scientist Development Program for Early-Career Physician-Scientists, Korea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI)
