- **Novel Gene Discovery and Understanding of Gene Functions in Human Diseases**  
  Identifying novel disease-associated genes and elucidating their biological functions to advance the understanding of human genetic disorders.  
  This work is grounded in **functional genomics**, which aims to interpret how genetic variants influence gene expression, protein function, cellular pathways, and ultimately disease phenotypes through integrative genomic and experimental approaches.
