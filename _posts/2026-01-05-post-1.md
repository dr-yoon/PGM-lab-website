We are excited to announce that the **first paper from our lab has been officially accepted for publication in *Nucleic Acids Research (NAR)*** 🎉

In this study, we introduce **TAILVAR**, a predictive framework that substantially improves the interpretation of **stop-loss variants**.
Unlike previous in silico models, TAILVAR explicitly incorporates the **biological characteristics of C-terminal extensions**, providing both enhanced predictive performance and new insights into genome-wide stop codon usage and its functional impact.

Our results highlight that features of C-terminal extensions—long overlooked in variant interpretation—play a critical role in determining the functional impact of stop-loss variants.
This work not only advances computational variant prediction but also deepens our understanding of protein biology beyond canonical termination.

Well done, and we’re excited for what comes next.
